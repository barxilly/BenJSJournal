# PWA Icons Setup

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create PNG versions of your icon:

1. Convert the `vite.svg` to PNG format in the following sizes:
   - 192x192 pixels → save as `icon-192.png`
   - 512x512 pixels → save as `icon-512.png`

2. Place these files in the `public/` directory

You can use online converters like:
- https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
- https://convertio.co/svg-png/
- Or use design tools like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop

For now, the app will work with just the SVG, but PNG icons provide better compatibility across all devices.
